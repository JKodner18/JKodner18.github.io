My recent work on the Jewish languages of Iran, with the HUC-JIR Jewish Language Project, was featured in an article published by *The Forward*. The article discusses a [grant](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Programs/Wikimedia_Community_Fund/Documenting_and_increasing_Jewish_language_representation_on_Wikimedia) of over $50,000 with the Wikimedia Foundation that I was accepted to. The purpose of the grant is to document varieties of Judeo-Iranian and Jewish Neo-Aramaic, primarily through filming oral histories and editing articles on Wikipedia.
