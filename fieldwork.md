### Manchu
Since 2021, I have been collaborating with speakers of Sibe, a dialect of Manchu (Tungusic: China) to develop documentation materials for the speaker community. This work, conducted remotely with speakers in China, is ongoing, and has culminated in resources including:

* A Sibe-Mandarin-English dictionary, with audio recordings
* An introductory phrasebook of the language, also with audio recordings
* A video archive of authentic language material (featuring collaborations with a few YouTubers)
* Other digital resources such as a romanization-to-IPA converter and a verb conjugation tool

All of these resources can be found on [_Mini Buleku_](https://minibuleku.github.io/) (lit. 'My Dictionary'), a website I developed to make our collaborations available to the community of speakers in China. Our work has been financially supported through the [Language Legacies Grant](http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org/ll_2022.html) with the Endangered Language Fund, along with internal grants at UC Irvine.

### Jewish Languages
Owing to my Jewish-Ukrainian heritage, I sought to apply my documentation experience in Manchu/Sibe to languages, mostly endangered, spoken by Jews across the world. From November 2021 to June 2022, I served as an inter-organizational intern with the [Jewish Language Consortium](https://www.jewishlanguages.org/consortium). Specifically, I worked to bridge documentation initiatives related to endangered Jewish languages across the following nonprofit organizations:

* [Wikitongues](https://wikitongues.org/team/), where I maintained and collected metadata for Jewish language videos in the organization's documentation archive
* [Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages](https://livingtongues.org/interns/), where I performed outreach and established the foundations for the creation of a recorded dictionary for Jewish Neo-Aramaic 
* [HUC-JIR Jewish Language Project](https://www.jewishlanguages.org/people), where I coordinated the filming, processing, and dissemination of more than 10 interviews, songs, plays and other cultural videos — featuring speakers of endangered Jewish languages (see bottom right)

​In June 2022, I was officially hired by the HUC-JIR Jewish Language to serve as the organization's Documentation Manager. Since then, I have continued developing multimedia content in endangered Jewish languages — specifically with speakers of Judeo-Iranian (see bottom left). I have also been contributing to the organization's fundraising initiatives through applying for grants with external funders ([recent grant](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Programs/Wikimedia_Community_Fund/Documenting_and_increasing_Jewish_language_representation_on_Wikimedia), accepted & awarded $54,000 USD in funding).
