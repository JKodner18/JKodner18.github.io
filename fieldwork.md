### Manchu
Since 2021, I have been collaborating with speakers of Sibe, a dialect of Manchu, to develop documentation materials for the speaker community. This work, conducted remotely with speakers in China, is ongoing and has culminated in resources including:

* A Sibe-Mandarin-English dictionary, with audio recordings
* An introductory phrasebook of the language, also with audio recordings
* A video archive of authentic language material (featuring collaborations with a few YouTubers)
* Other digital resources such as a romanization-to-IPA converter and a verb conjugation tool

All of these resources can be found on [Mini Buleku](https://minibuleku.github.io/) (lit. 'My Dictionary'), a website I developed to make our collaborations available to the community of speakers in China. Our work has been financially supported through the [Language Legacies Grant](http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org/ll_2022.html) with the Endangered Language Fund, along with internal grants at UC Irvine. 

In terms of my theoretical research, I've worked with speakers of Manchu to research and collect data on converbs constructions, which I discuss in my proceedings for _SICOGG 24_. Among the theoretical topics I’m interested in investigating further in the language are: the syntax-prosody of converbs, vowel harmony, case markers, and the causative-passive correlation.

### Atayal

I've been connected with the Atayal community since my trip to Taiwan during my gap year prior to beginning at UC Irvine. Since then, I’ve worked closely with speakers of the Squliq dialect to research evidentiality, specifically by conducting a Mandarin-to-Atayal translation task. Down the road, I’m interested in researching the syntax-prosody of serial verb constructions in the language.

Beyond my theoretical work, I’ve been collaborating with an Atayal language teacher and publisher to translate Mandarin-Atayal curriculum from the online educational platform [_Klokah_](https://web.klokah.tw/) into English to further facilitate learning of the language.

### Jewish Languages
Owing to my Jewish-Ukrainian heritage, I sought to apply my documentation experience to endangered Jewish language varieties. From November 2021 to June 2022, I served as an inter-organizational intern with the [Jewish Language Consortium](https://www.jewishlanguages.org/consortium). Specifically, I worked to bridge documentation initiatives related to endangered Jewish languages across the following nonprofit organizations:

* [Wikitongues](https://wikitongues.org/team/), where I maintained and collected metadata for Jewish language videos in the organization's documentation archive
* [Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages](https://livingtongues.org/interns/), where I performed outreach and established the foundations for the creation of a recorded dictionary for Jewish Neo-Aramaic 
* [HUC-JIR Jewish Language Project](https://www.jewishlanguages.org/people), where I coordinated the filming, processing, and dissemination of more than 10 interviews, songs, plays and other cultural videos — featuring speakers of endangered Jewish languages

​In June 2022, I was officially hired by the HUC-JIR Jewish Language to serve as the organization's Documentation Manager. Since then, I have continued developing multimedia content in endangered Jewish languages — specifically with speakers of Judeo-Iranian and Jewish Neo-Aramaic. I have also been contributing to the organization's fundraising initiatives by applying for grants with external funders ([recent grant](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Programs/Wikimedia_Community_Fund/Documenting_and_increasing_Jewish_language_representation_on_Wikimedia), accepted & awarded $54,000 USD in funding).
