### About Me
Hello! I am incoming PhD student at Harvard Linguisitcs. I received my BA in Language Science from the University of California, Irvine in 2022. My research interests span syntax and its interfaces, and I pursue these research interests through fieldwork with speakers of under-described and endangered languages of East Asia. I have also been invested in the field of endangered language documentation.
