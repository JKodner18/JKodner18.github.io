### About Me

Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University. I received my BA in Language Science from the University of California, Irvine in 2022. My research interests span syntax and its interfaces (see [Research](http://kodner.org/research)), and I pursue these research interests through fieldwork with speakers of under-described and endangered languages ([Fieldwork](http://kodner.org/fieldwork)), primarily those from East Asia. To supplement my theoretical linguistics research, I also conduct endangered language documentation work with a handful of language communities.


When I am not doing linguistics, I enjoy going on long-distance walks, checking out local bubble tea shops (or making my own), and watching Korean dramas. I also enjoy traveling and have been to Taiwan on numerous occasions.
