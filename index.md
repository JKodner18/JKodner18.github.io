## Research Interests
* Broad: syntax, fieldwork, endangered languages 
* Narrow: multi-verb constructions (converbs, SVCs), nonsententials (fragment answers), causative-passives, syntactic interfaces with phonology and morphology
* Languages: Altaic (Manchu, Mongolian, Korean), Formosan (Atayal)


## About Me

Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University. I received my BA in Language Science from the University of California, Irvine in 2022. My research is primarily in syntax and its interfaces, and I am particularly interested in the various morphosyntactic phenomena occurring in the verbal domain and their interactions with other aspects of the grammar â€” such as prosody. 

As a firm believer in the importance of linguistic diversity in carrying out language-related research, I pursue my research interests through conducting linguistic elicitations and fieldwork with speakers of under-described and endangered languages (see [Projects](/projects)). With the hopes of giving back to the linguistic communities I work with, I also collaborate with speakers of endangered languages in documenting their languages to encourage preservation, and producing pedagogical resources to encourage further transmission.


When I am not doing linguistics, I enjoy going on long-distance walks, checking out local bubble tea shops (or making my own), and watching Korean dramas. I also enjoy traveling and have been to Taiwan on numerous occasions.
