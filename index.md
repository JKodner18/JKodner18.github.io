## Research Interests
* Broad: syntax and its interfaces, syntax-prosody, morphology, fieldwork, endangered languages 
* Narrow: locality domains in syntax-PF, prosodic resolution of attachment ambiguities, multi-verb constructions (converbs, SVCs), nonsententials (fragment answers)
* Languages: Altaic (Manchu, Mongolian, Korean), Formosan (Atayal), Muskogean (Alabama)


## About Me

Hello! I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University. I am advised by Jonathan Bobaljik and Tanya Bondarenko. I am a member of the [WOLF Lab](https://fieldlinguistics.github.io/) and [PhonLab](https://sites.harvard.edu/phonlab/people/) at Harvard. My research is primarily in syntax and its interfaces, and I am particularly interested in the various morphosyntactic phenomena occurring in the verbal domain and their interactions with other components of the grammar ‚Äî such as prosody. I received my BA in Language Science from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in 2022. 

As a firm believer in the importance of linguistic diversity in carrying out language-related research, I pursue my research interests through conducting linguistic elicitations and fieldwork with speakers of under-described and endangered languages (see [Projects](/projects)). With the hopes of giving back to the linguistic communities I work with, I also collaborate with speakers of endangered languages in documenting their languages to encourage preservation, and producing pedagogical resources to encourage further transmission.


When I am not doing linguistics, I enjoy going on long-distance walks, checking out local bubble tea shops (or making my own), and watching Korean dramas. I also enjoy traveling and have been to Taiwan on numerous occasions.

## Recent News
* 5/31-6/21: I traveled with the WOLF Lab to the Alabama-Coushatta reservation in Texas for a [fieldwork expedition](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/2/alabama-language-project/)
* 8/22-8/24: I will be giving an oral talk on my work on the syntax-prosody of converbs at SICOGG26/WAFL18 in Jeonju, South Korea
