### About Me
Hello! I am incoming PhD student at Harvard Linguisitcs. I received my BA in Language Science from the University of California, Irvine in 2022. My research interests span syntax and its interfaces, and I pursue these research interests through fieldwork with speakers of under-described and endangered languages of East Asia (see [Research](http://kodner.org/research)). In addition to theoretical linguistics, I have worked in the field of endangered language documentation to create educational and practical resources for Manchu, specifically the Sibe dialect, as well as Jewish languages of my own heritage (see [Documentation](http://kodner.org/documentation)).
